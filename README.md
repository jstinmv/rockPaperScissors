# rockPaperScissors

First project ever. rockPaperScissors is written fron scratch. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also utiliting GIT to manage my code. Website is posted on github pages as well. :)

Website completed at 10:44pm on October 10, 2022. Game is bugging and I need to change a few things. But as of this point the website if fully functions

Functioning
-Can chose paper rock or scissors icons to play a round.
-Winner of round is declared (player, computer, tie) and score is incremented plus 1.
-To win the match must be the first to win 5 rounds.
-Alert pops up declaring the winner of the match and resets the scoreboard.

**_Upcoming Changes_**

To Remove:
-Alert declaring winner. Clicking on alert is supposed to reset the game but doesnt.

To Add:
-Button on bottom of screen that resets scoreboard to zero for player and computer.
-Icon of skull or happy face that dynamically changes to display winner of round.
-Bigger and more obvious visual queue that there has been a tie. (right now it looks like nothing happened. But its showing in the console when tested.)
-Better styling with CSS, change colors, change fonts, and shadows for depth.
